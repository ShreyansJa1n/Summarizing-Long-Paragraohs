    # Acharya J.C. Bose was a scientist of many talents. He was born on 30 November, 1858 in Bikrampur, West Bengal. He was a polymath, physicist, biologist, botanist and archaeologist. Bose pioneered the study of radio and microwave optics. He made important contributions to the study of plants. He has laid the foundation of experimental science in the Indian sub-continent. He was the first person to use semiconductor junctions to detect radio signals. Whatâ€™s more, he is also probably the father of open technology, as he made his inventions and work freely available for others to further develop and his reluctance for patenting his work is legendary.
    # Another of his well known inventions is the crescograph. He measured plant response to various stimuli and hypothesized that plants can feel pain, understand affection etc.
    # While most of us are aware of his scientific prowess, we might not be aware of his talent as an early writer of science fiction! He is in fact considered the father of Bengali science fiction.
